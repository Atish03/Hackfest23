## General info
This project aims to create a Chrome extension voice bot that will help visually impaired individuals order food online. As part of this project, we will be integrating a speech-to-text library to enable the voice bot to convert the user's spoken commands into text.

## Prerequisites
To use the speech-to-text library, you will need to have the following installed:
* Python programming language
* Pyttsx3 library
* Google Cloud SDK

## Installation
* Install the Pyttsx3 library by running the following command:
```
$ pip install pyttsx3
```

## Usage
* To use the speech-to-text library, you will need to import the library and authenticate with the Google Cloud project that you set up earlier.
* Then set up a speech recognizer and microphone using the speech_recognition library, listens for speech input, and converts the speech to text using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
